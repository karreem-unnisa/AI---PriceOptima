For the AI: PriceOptima project, I worked on collecting and cleaning three datasets: retail_store_inventory.csv, popular_ecomm_marketplace-Ecommerce__20231101_20231130_sample (2).csv, and dynamic_pricing.csv.

First, I loaded all three datasets using pandas and printed out the first few rows, their shapes, and their column names to understand the data I was working with.

Next, I took care of missing values. In the inventory dataset, I filled any missing values in the inventory_available column with zero. For the marketplace dataset, I used forward-fill to handle other missing values. In the pricing dataset, I dropped rows that were missing critical fields like price or units sold, if those columns existed.

I then removed duplicate rows in all three datasets to ensure every record was unique.

To make the data types consistent, I converted the date columns to datetime format where present, and made sure that number columns (like price, units sold, inventory available, and competitor price) were all numeric.

I also handled outliers by removing extreme values in price and units sold that were above the 99th percentile in their respective datasets.

After cleaning up the individual files, I tried to merge them together based on columns they had in common, which were usually product_id and date. If those columns weren’t available in all datasets, I continued with the pricing dataset as my main file.

Finally, I saved the result as priceoptima_cleaned.csv, which is now ready for the next steps of the project such as feature engineering and modeling.

This process makes sure the data is complete, clean, and in good shape for building dynamic pricing models.
